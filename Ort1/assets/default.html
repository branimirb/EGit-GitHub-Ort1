	<h4>
		<a name="Main">Main Screen & More Readouts Screen</a>
	</h4>
	<p>
		You may choose the readouts for the three sections of these screens by
		performing a <b><i>long-press</i></b> on a specific section. After
		pressing the Menu button and going to "Settings", if you disable the
		option "Lock portrait screen orientation for readouts screens" the
		first of three readouts will take up the whole screen in case the
		device is put in the horizontal orientation. Long press back button
		for returning to Main Screen.
	<h4>
		<a name="Race">Race Timer Screen</a>
	</h4>
	<p>
		By pressing gear icon in bottom right corner of a screen, you may
		change initial time to race, or choose use of <b><i>multiclass</i></b>
		mode. In handicap mode you may change time offset between two classes.
		After starting a race this settings is not available.
	<h4>
		<a name="Gestures">Gestures</a>
	</h4>
	<p>
		The user is able to navigate through the circle of screens by
		performing a <b><i>swipe</i></b> (fling) gesture across the screen to
		the left or to the right. <br>A <b><i>Z Gesture</i></b> (its path
		resembles the capital letter "Z") is used for locking and unlocking
		the screen.
	<h4>
		<a name="Buoys">Buoys</a>
	</h4>
	<p>
		The <b>start line</b> of a race is a line from <b>Pin</b> (its port
		side) to the <b>Race Committee</b> (its starboard side). Other than
		that are also the three <b>markers</b> and the <b>finish line</b>.
	<p>
		The <i>Buoys</i> screen enables you to record the coordinates of the
		buoys - either by coming to their location (long-press a buoy) or by <b>recording
			two directions to the buoy from two different locations</b> (press
		"Direction To" button) - the program will compute their intersection
		and save it as the buoy's position. Recording these directions is an
		action very similar to <a href="#WindDirSailInto">recording wind
			direction by sailing into it</a>.
	<h4>
		<a name="WindDirSailInto">Recording True Wind Direction by Sailing
			Into It</a>
	</h4>
	<p>
		Go to the <i>True Wind Direction</i> screen. Then press "Record" to
		memorize bearings received from the GPS while sailing directly into
		the wind. After clicking on "Stop", the program will offer you an
		average value of the bearings recorded which you may fine-tune using
		the "+" and "-" buttons. You may also use the "Use compass" button
		which will swap the current value with the current heading provided by
		the compass.
	<p>Program's first guess at the wind direction is the start line's
		centerline.
	<h4>
		<a name="Tracks">Tracks</a>
	</h4>
	<p>
		The path recorded since the application started to the moment the user
		leaves the application is referred to as a track. The user can <b>reset</b>
		the track's beginning on the <i>Stats</i> screen. <br>A
		"Stopwatch Track" presents the path made while the stopwatch was on,
		and a "GPX Track" is a track loaded from a <i>.gpx</i> file.
	<p>
		Choosing the <i>Tracks</i> option inside the Menu will show a list of
		tracks. Clicking on a track inside the list will present a map that
		shows the complete recorded path. Long-press will provide the user
		with a list of options for the selected track (one of them being
		reviewing its <a href="#Legs">legs and tacks</a>).
	<h4>
		<a name="Legs">Legs and Tacks</a>
	</h4>
	<p>
		A leg is a part of the track that can be between markers or between
		the start/finish line and a marker. <br>Each leg has segments
		that show one approximately steady course - tacks! Statistics
		referring to tacks will be displayed in an expandable list for each
		leg.
	<h4>
		<a name="WindDirCenterline">Recording True Wind Direction as a
			Centerline of Two Directions</a>
	</h4>
	<p>
		After clicking on this button button on the <i>True Wind Direction</i>
		screen, the program will automatically note the directions of the next
		two tacks and compute the true wind direction as their centerline.
		(This button will turn yellow after the first tack and turn green and
		display the wind direction value after the second one).
	<h4>
		<a name="Currents">Measuring Currents</a>
	</h4>
	<p>The idea is to throw a pin in the water and press "Record". Than
		you wait for the current to move it and once you get to the pin's new
		position, press "Stop". The program will then compute the velocity of
		the current and display it.
	<h4>
		<a name="ASAP">Rounding modes</a>
	</h4>
	<p>You can choose between two modes for buoy rounding.<br>
		<i>ASAP mode</i> will detect incoming buoy as soon as possible while you are approaching it.
		It means that application will detect buoy rounding before physical rounding happens.<br>
		<i>ALAP mode</i> will detect buoy rounding after physical rounding happens.
		It means that application will detect buoy rounding while physical rounding is happening, 
		but signal user when he starts to moving away from the buoy.
